// let say we have a 3x3 grid and we want to find the ways to travel to some other point.
// we have  some base cases lets say gridTraveller(2,0) will be the number of ways to travel will be 0 same for 0,1 - ,1,0 8,0 is 0
// for 1x1 its 1

// for a 2x3 we will have to go downward lets think of as tree for left child we can decrease the row and for right we can decrease column
